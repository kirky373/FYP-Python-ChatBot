# Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence
# research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including
# customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often
# powered by retrieval-based models, which output predefined responses to
# questions of certain forms. In a highly restricted domain like a
# company’s IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are
# not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to
# carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is
# a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning
# boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google’s `Neural
# Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__, which marks
# a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In
# this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch.

# Load & Preprocess Data
# ----------------------
#
# The next step is to reformat our data file and load the data into
# structures that we can work with.
#
# The `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
# Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__
# is a rich dataset of movie character dialog:
#
# -  220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie
#    characters
# -  9,035 characters from 617 movies
# -  304,713 total utterances
#
# This dataset is large and diverse, and there is a great variation of

# Define Models
# -------------
#
# Seq2Seq Model
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The brains of our chatbot is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. The
# goal of a seq2seq model is to take a variable-length sequence as an
# input, and return a variable-length sequence as an output using a
# fixed-sized model.
#
# `Sutskever et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__ discovered that
# by using two separate recurrent neural nets together, we can accomplish
# this task. One RNN acts as an **encoder**, which encodes a variable
# length input sequence to a fixed-length context vector. In theory, this
# context vector (the final hidden layer of the RNN) will contain semantic
# information about the query sentence that is input to the bot. The
# second RNN is a **decoder**, which takes an input word and the context
# vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a
# hidden state to use in the next iteration.
#


######################################################################
# Encoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token
# (e.g. word) at a time, at each time step outputting an “output” vector
# and a “hidden state” vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to
# the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder
# transforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set
# of points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to
# generate a meaningful output for the given task.
#
# At the heart of our encoder is a multi-layered Gated Recurrent Unit,
# invented by `Cho et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__ in
# 2014. We will use a bidirectional variant of the GRU, meaning that there
# are essentially two independent RNNs: one that is fed the input sequence
# in normal sequential order, and one that is fed the input sequence in
# reverse order. The outputs of each network are summed at each time step.
# Using a bidirectional GRU will give us the advantage of encoding both
# past and future context.
#
# Note that an ``embedding`` layer is used to encode our word indices in
# an arbitrarily sized feature space. For our models, this layer will map
# each word to a feature space of size *hidden_size*. When trained, these
# values should encode semantic similarity between similar meaning words.
#
# Finally, if passing a padded batch of sequences to an RNN module, we
# must pack and unpack padding around the RNN pass using
# ``nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`` and
# ``nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`` respectively.
#
# **Computation Graph:**
#
#    1) Convert word indexes to embeddings.
#    2) Pack padded batch of sequences for RNN module.
#    3) Forward pass through GRU.
#    4) Unpack padding.
#    5) Sum bidirectional GRU outputs.
#    6) Return output and final hidden state.
#
# **Inputs:**
#
# -  ``input_seq``: batch of input sentences; shape=\ *(max_length,
#    batch_size)*
# -  ``input_lengths``: list of sentence lengths corresponding to each
#    sentence in the batch; shape=\ *(batch_size)*
# -  ``hidden``: hidden state; shape=\ *(n_layers x num_directions,
#    batch_size, hidden_size)*
#
# **Outputs:**
#
# -  ``outputs``: output features from the last hidden layer of the GRU
#    (sum of bidirectional outputs); shape=\ *(max_length, batch_size,
#    hidden_size)*
# -  ``hidden``: updated hidden state from GRU; shape=\ *(n_layers x
#    num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)*
#
#


######################################################################
# Single training iteration
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The ``train`` function contains the algorithm for a single training
# iteration (a single batch of inputs).
#
# We will use a couple of clever tricks to aid in convergence:
#
# -  The first trick is using **teacher forcing**. This means that at some
#    probability, set by ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, we use the current
#    target word as the decoder’s next input rather than using the
#    decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for
#    the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher
#    forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the
#    decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own
#    output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we
#    are setting the ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, and not be fooled by fast
#    convergence.
#
# -  The second trick that we implement is **gradient clipping**. This is
#    a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient”
#    problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a
#    maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially
#    and either overflow (NaN), or overshoot steep cliffs in the cost
#    function.
#
#
# **Sequence of Operations:**
#
#    1) Forward pass entire input batch through encoder.
#    2) Initialize decoder inputs as SOS_token, and hidden state as the encoder's final hidden state.
#    3) Forward input batch sequence through decoder one time step at a time.
#    4) If teacher forcing: set next decoder input as the current target; else: set next decoder input as current decoder output.
#    5) Calculate and accumulate loss.
#    6) Perform backpropagation.
#    7) Clip gradients.
#    8) Update encoder and decoder model parameters.
#
#
# .. Note ::
#
#   PyTorch’s RNN modules (``RNN``, ``LSTM``, ``GRU``) can be used like any
#   other non-recurrent layers by simply passing them the entire input
#   sequence (or batch of sequences). We use the ``GRU`` layer like this in
#   the ``encoder``. The reality is that under the hood, there is an
#   iterative process looping over each time step calculating hidden states.
#   Alternatively, you ran run these modules one time-step at a time. In
#   this case, we manually loop over the sequences during the training
#   process like we must do for the ``decoder`` model. As long as you
#   maintain the correct conceptual model of these modules, implementing
#   sequential models can be very straightforward.
#
