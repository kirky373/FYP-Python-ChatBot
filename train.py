# Prepare Data for Models
# -----------------------
#
# Although we have put a great deal of effort into preparing and massaging our
# data into a nice vocabulary object and list of sentence pairs, our models
# will ultimately expect numerical torch tensors as inputs. One way to
# prepare the processed data for the models can be found in the `seq2seq
# translation
# tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__.
# In that tutorial, we use a batch size of 1, meaning that all we have to
# do is convert the words in our sentence pairs to their corresponding
# indexes from the vocabulary and feed this to the models.
#
# However, if you’re interested in speeding up training and/or would like
# to leverage GPU parallelization capabilities, you will need to train
# with mini-batches.
#
# Using mini-batches also means that we must be mindful of the variation
# of sentence length in our batches. To accomodate sentences of different
# sizes in the same batch, we will make our batched input tensor of shape
# *(max_length, batch_size)*, where sentences shorter than the
# *max_length* are zero padded after an *EOS_token*.
#
# If we simply convert our English sentences to tensors by converting
# words to their indexes(\ ``indexesFromSentence``) and zero-pad, our
# tensor would have shape *(batch_size, max_length)* and indexing the
# first dimension would return a full sequence across all time-steps.
# However, we need to be able to index our batch along time, and across
# all sequences in the batch. Therefore, we transpose our input batch
# shape to *(max_length, batch_size)*, so that indexing across the first
# dimension returns a time step across all sentences in the batch. We
# handle this transpose implicitly in the ``zeroPadding`` function.
#
# The ``inputVar`` function handles the process of converting sentences to
# tensor, ultimately creating a correctly shaped zero-padded tensor. It
# also returns a tensor of ``lengths`` for each of the sequences in the
# batch which will be passed to our decoder later.
#
# The ``outputVar`` function performs a similar function to ``inputVar``,
# but instead of returning a ``lengths`` tensor, it returns a binary mask
# tensor and a maximum target sentence length. The binary mask tensor has
# the same shape as the output target tensor, but every element that is a
# *PAD_token* is 0 and all others are 1.
#
# ``batch2TrainData`` simply takes a bunch of pairs and returns the input
# and target tensors using the aforementioned functions.

# Masked loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Since we are dealing with batches of padded sequences, we cannot simply

# ``maskNLLLoss`` to calculate our loss based on our decoder’s output
# tensor, the target tensor, and a binary mask tensor describing the
# padding of the target tensor. This loss function calculates the average
# negative log likelihood of the elements that correspond to a *1* in the
# mask tensor.

# Single training iteration
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The ``train`` function contains the algorithm for a single training
# iteration (a single batch of inputs).
#
# We will use a couple of clever tricks to aid in convergence:
#
# -  The first trick is using **teacher forcing**. This means that at some
#    probability, set by ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, we use the current
#    target word as the decoder’s next input rather than using the
#    decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for
#    the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher
#    forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the
#    decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own
#    output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we
#    are setting the ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, and not be fooled by fast
#    convergence.
#
# -  The second trick that we implement is **gradient clipping**. This is
#    a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient”
#    problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a
#    maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially
#    and either overflow (NaN), or overshoot steep cliffs in the cost
#    function.
#
#
# **Sequence of Operations:**
#
#    1) Forward pass entire input batch through encoder.
#    2) Initialize decoder inputs as SOS_token, and hidden state as the encoder's final hidden state.
#    3) Forward input batch sequence through decoder one time step at a time.
#    4) If teacher forcing: set next decoder input as the current target; else: set next decoder input as current decoder output.
#    5) Calculate and accumulate loss.
#    6) Perform backpropagation.
#    7) Clip gradients.
#    8) Update encoder and decoder model parameters.
#
#
# .. Note ::
#
#   PyTorch’s RNN modules (``RNN``, ``LSTM``, ``GRU``) can be used like any
#   other non-recurrent layers by simply passing them the entire input
#   sequence (or batch of sequences). We use the ``GRU`` layer like this in
#   the ``encoder``. The reality is that under the hood, there is an
#   iterative process looping over each time step calculating hidden states.
#   Alternatively, you ran run these modules one time-step at a time. In
#   this case, we manually loop over the sequences during the training
#   process like we must do for the ``decoder`` model. As long as you
#   maintain the correct conceptual model of these modules, implementing
#   sequential models can be very straightforward.
